Mole mash instructions and functions

A mole pops up at random locations on the
screen, moving once every second.
Tapping the mole causes the device to vibrate,
increment a display of hits and moves mole to a new location.
Tapping the screen but missing the mole increments a display of misses.
Pressing a Reset button resets the counts of hits and misses.
